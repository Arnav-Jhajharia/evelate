    speaker: 'You',
    content: 'So, the scientists took a potted plant and did a few things to it. First, they kept the plant in the dark for a couple of days to remove any food that was already stored in the leaves. Then, they plucked a green leaf from the plant and covered a part of it with a black strip. The uncovered part was exposed to sunlight for a few hours.'
  },
  { speaker: 'Child', content: 'Why did they cover part of the leaf?' },
  {
    speaker: 'You',
    content: 'Good question! By covering part of the leaf, they wanted to see if the covered part would be different from the uncovered part when it comes to making food. Then, they boiled the leaf in water and a special liquid called ethanol to prepare it for a test.'
  },
  { speaker: 'Child', content: 'What kind of test did they do?' },

  },
  {
    speaker: 'You',
    content: "It tells us that the sunlight-exposed parts of the leaf had a substance called starch, which is like food for plants. The parts that were not exposed to sunlight didn't have starch. So, this experiment showed that light is really important for plants to make their own food through photosynthesis."

In our body, substances like blood and oxygen act as the fuel to keep our body going.'

The digestive system includes our stomach, liver, and intestines, and it helps us break down and absorb food. The nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, and it helps us sense things and control your body's movements. The excretory system includes kidneys, bladder, and urethra, and it helps us get rid of waste products. All of these systems work together to keep our body healthy and functioning properly"

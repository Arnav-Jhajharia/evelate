  },
  {
    speaker: 'Child',
    content: 'Umm, is it like a set of steps to solve a problem?'
  },
  {
    speaker: 'Child',
    content: "Exactly! An algorithm is a bunch of steps to solve a problem. Now, let's imagine you have two ways of solving a problem. One way takes 10 steps, and the other way takes 100 steps. Big O Notation helps us understand which way is faster. It's like comparing how long it takes to finish homework."
  },
  {
    speaker: 'Child',
    content: 'Oh, like when I finish my math homework faster than my reading homework?'
  },
  {
    speaker: 'Child',
    content: "Yes, that's a good comparison! Big O Notation helps us figure out which algorithm is faster, just like you comparing your math and reading homework. It helps us choose the most efficient way to solve a problem."
  },
  {
    speaker: 'Child',
    content: 'So, Big O Notation helps us find the fastest way to solve a problem, right?'
  },
  {
    speaker: 'Child',
    content: 'Absolutely! Big O Notation is a fancy way to measure how quickly an algorithm runs as the problem gets bigger. You see, when you have a lot of things to do, like sorting a lot of numbers, some algorithms are faster than others. Big O Notation tells us how the speed changes when the problem gets bigger.'
  },
  { speaker: 'Child', content: 'How does it work exactly?' },
  {
    speaker: 'Child',
    content: "Well, let's imagine we have two algorithms, Algorithm A and Algorithm B. Algorithm A takes twice as long as Algorithm B to solve a problem with 10 items. Now, if we double the problem size to 20 items, Algorithm A might take four times longer, while Algorithm B only takes twice as long. Big O Notation helps us compare these differences in speed as the problem size increases."

  {
    speaker: 'You',
    content: "To access web pages, we use web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. When you type a web address (URL) into the browser's address bar, it sends a request to a special computer called a server. This server holds the web page you want to see."

  },
  {
    speaker: 'You',

It uses special tags, which are like labels, to define different parts of the page. For example, there's a tag called "h1" for headings, "p" for paragraphs, and "img" for images. These tags help organize the content and make it easy to understand.`

Instead of using fixed pixel-based measurements for elements on a web page, flexible grids use relative units like percentages.
